## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Sundeep from India, who is trying his best to learn Rust language as much as possible. The following projects serve as a consolidated showcase of Solana-based programs and contributions authored or co-authored by me. The focus is on smart contract development in Rust, CLI tooling, and ecosystem infrastructure built over the years across DeFi, NFT, gaming, and ZK-related domains.

## ðŸ”¹ Solana PubKey TokenGator (Hackathon Winner)
**Repository:** [tokengator-program-library](https://github.com/pubkeyapp/tokengator-program-library)  
**Context:** Built for the Solana x Jump DeFi Hackathon (2024), this project implemented the Token-2022 extensions standard for programmable token behavior. Recognized as a winning submission and awarded a $25K prize.

## ðŸ”¹ Wen Protocol Contributions
**Repository:** [wen-program-library](https://github.com/wen-community/wen-program-library)  
**Context:** Extended the Tokengator foundation into a production-grade protocol for the WEN Foundation. Delivered new features and a full CLI suite. Project integration contributed to ecosystem infrastructure adoption.

## ðŸ”¹ Kriya Credit (Sui Ecosystem)
**Repository:** [kriya-credit-packages](https://github.com/efficacy-finance/kriya-credit-packages)  
**Context:** Contributed during the Sui Overflow Hackathon. Helped design and implement lending logic on the Sui blockchain. Core implementation was used in the hackathon-winning project.

## ðŸ”¹ Metaboss: Metaplex CLI Tooling
**Repository:** [metaboss](https://github.com/samuelvanderwaal/metaboss)  
**Context:** CLI tool for Metaplex token metadata operations, built in pure Rust. Early contributor in 2021â€“2022. One of the most widely adopted tools for NFT creators and infrastructure builders on Solana.

## ðŸ”¹ DogeTrackContracts: RNG Game Contracts
**Repository:** [dogetrackcontracts](https://github.com/sunguru98/dogetrackcontracts)  
**Context:** Smart contracts for a fully on-chain, randomized horse racing game. Developed for a high-value bounty (~$30K), showcasing randomization, settlement logic, and game mechanics on Solana.

## ðŸ”¹ NFT Staking via Quarry Protocol
**Repository:** [nft-staking-quarry](https://github.com/sunguru98/nft-staking-quarry)  
**Context:** Converted an existing fungible token staking platform into NFT staking using the Quarry protocol. The foundation for what later became Honey Finance.

## ðŸ”¹ Holaplex Reward Center
**Repository:** [reward-center-program](https://github.com/holaplex/reward-center-program)  
**Context:** Developed incentive smart contracts to reward NFT buyers and sellers with market tokens. This became the backend for NightMarket (now under different ownership).

## ðŸ”¹ Asgard Forge (NFT Fusion Frontend)
**Repository:** [asgard-forge-front](https://github.com/sunguru98/asgard-forge-front)  
**Context:** Web-based interface for NFT fusion (e.g., character + item into a new asset). Integrated Arweave Bundlr (now Iryz) and custom image generation logic using the HashLips template.

## ðŸ”¹ Non-Anchor Solana Whitelisting Program
**Repository:** [solana-whitelisting-program](https://github.com/sunguru98/solana-whitelisting-program)  
**Context:** One of the earliest Solana smart contracts written without the Anchor framework. Implemented a whitelisting logic using native Solana runtime. Received significant community engagement upon release.

## ðŸ”¹ Reclaim Protocol â€“ ZK Witness Partial Port to Solana
**Repository:** [reclaim-solana-sdk](https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/reclaim-solana-sdk)  
**Context:** Ported Ethereum-based zero-knowledge witness signature verification (v, r, s) to Solana. Tasked with translating EVM-centric logic to Solana-native constructs in under a week.
**sunguru98/sunguru98** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
